Key Management Middleware Selection

Chosen Solution: HashiCorp Vault

HashiCorp Vault is a popular open-source key management middleware solution that offers a centralized platform for managing encryption keys, secrets, and other sensitive data. We chose Vault for several reasons:

  - Centralized Control: Vault provides a single point of control for all your encryption keys, simplifying management and access control.

  - Strong Security Features: Vault offers robust security features like granular access control, encryption at rest and in transit, and audit logging.

  - Flexibility: Vault integrates with various cloud providers (including AWS) and supports diverse key types and cryptographic operations.

  - Open Source: Being open-source allows for customization and community support, making it a cost-effective option.


Benefits of Key Management Middleware Over Direct KMS Integration

While AWS KMS offers a powerful key management service, using a key management middleware like Vault provides several advantages:

  - Unified Platform: Vault can manage keys from various sources, including AWS KMS, cloud providers like Azure and GCP, and on-premises HSMs. This simplifies key management across a hybrid cloud environment.

  - Enhanced Security: Vault provides additional security features like secret lifecycle management (rotation, revocation), auditing, and integration with external identity providers for access control.

  - Improved Workflow Efficiency: Vault streamlines key management workflows with features like automated key rotation and integration with DevOps tools.

Data Flow and Key Management Processes:

  1. Applications/Services request encryption keys or perform key management operations (generation, rotation, revocation) from the Key Management Middleware (Vault).
  2. Vault interacts with AWS KMS via its API or SDK to perform the requested operation on the relevant CMK (Customer Master Key).
  3. Vault might cache frequently used keys or manage key versions internally for improved performance and rotation policies.
  4. All key management actions and access attempts are logged for audit purposes and sent to a centralized logging or monitoring system.

Key Management Workflows

1. Key Generation:
  - Applications request key generation through Vault.
  - Vault interacts with AWS KMS to generate a new CMK according to specified parameters (e.g., key type, algorithm).
  - Vault retrieves the CMK details from KMS and securely stores them within its own internal key store.

2. Key Rotation:
  - Vault implements automated key rotation policies to ensure the ongoing security of CMKs.
  - When a key rotation is triggered, Vault generates a new CMK in AWS KMS and updates its internal key store.
  - Applications are transparently switched to the new key without requiring code changes.

3. Key Revocation:
  - Vault allows applications to request key revocation for compromised or unused keys.
  - Vault marks the key as revoked in its internal store and stops issuing it to applications.
  - The corresponding CMK in AWS KMS remains accessible for decryption of previously encrypted data but is no longer usable for new encryption operations.

Challenges and Solutions:

  - Integration Complexity: Integrating Vault with AWS KMS requires configuration and setting up appropriate IAM policies for secure communication. We used the official Vault AWS plugin and followed best practices for secure IAM role creation and access control.
  - Performance Optimization: To optimize performance, we leveraged Vault's caching mechanisms and configured it to minimize unnecessary calls to AWS KMS.


Access Control and Auditing

1. Access Control:
  - Vault enforces granular access control using policies that define which users or applications can access specific keys or perform key management operations.
  - Integration with IAM or other identity providers allows for centralized user management and access control enforcement.

2. Auditing and Logging:
  - All key management actions (generation, rotation, revocation) and access attempts are logged within Vault.
  - These logs are integrated with a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK Stack) for analysis and monitoring.
  - Vault also offers audit functionality to track key usage patterns and identify potential anomalies.


Secure Transport Protocols

HTTPS and TLS Implementation:

  - All communication between applications, Vault, and AWS KMS is secured using HTTPS with TLS encryption.
  - We leverage AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for obtaining and managing SSL/TLS certificates for all components involved in the communication.
  - We follow best practices like strong cipher suites, certificate validation, and regular certificate rotation to ensure the ongoing security of TLS connections.


Data Encryption in Transit

Data Encryption Mechanisms:

  - All data in transit between applications, Vault, and AWS KMS is encrypted using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
  - We leverage AWS KMS or Vault (depending on the scenario) to manage the encryption keys
